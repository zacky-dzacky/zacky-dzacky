**🌱 Senior Full-Stack & Mobile Developer (10+ Years) | AI & ML Specialist**

I've been working in mobile development for over 10 years, starting back when 'mobile-first' design was the big hype. In late 2023, after read Sam Altman tweeted about Language User Interfaces, I realized that AI would disrupt the way we interact with products. Since then, I have invested my time in reading papers and books, and experimenting with open models.

Throughout this journey, I’ve learned various topics including Machine Learning (specifically Deep Neural Networks), MLOps, Data Engineering, MCP, Backend, and Web Applications. I am evolving into a full-stack developer with a strong AI background.

I once watched a video of Jensen Huang giving a talk at Stanford. He said that he doesn't believe in vision; he believes in perspective. He didn't necessarily have a grand 'vision' for NVIDIA; however, because he was so passionate about GPUs, he had a unique perspective that allowed him to stand firm, even when the GPU market wasn't doing well. And then the rest is history. 

Because of my love for mobile development and my broad perspective on the industry, I believe the future of foundation models lies in on-device mobile shipping. I am preparing myself for when that moment fully arrives.
